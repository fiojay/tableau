# tableau

Tableau is a chrome extension that uses the <a href = "http://www.artsy.net">Artsy</a> API to display a different piece of famous artwork each time a new tab is opened. Made as a means to force myself to be exposed to new art!

There are a couple of bugs. It is a work in progress to be optimized.
